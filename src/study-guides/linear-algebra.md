## Vectors

Think of a vector as an arrow. Imagine you're standing on a flat piece of paper, and you have an arrow that you can place anywhere on that paper. This arrow has two important properties:

- Direction: The arrow points in a specific direction. You can think of this as the way the arrow is pointing on the paper.
- Magnitude: The arrow has a length, which you can think of as how long the arrow is.

In mathematics, we represent vectors using numbers. For example, if you have an arrow pointing three units to the right and four units up, we can represent that as a vector (3, 4). Here's how we break it down:

The number 3 represents how far to the right the arrow points.
The number 4 represents how far up the arrow points.
So, the vector (3, 4) is like an arrow that starts at the origin (the center of your paper) and goes three units to the right and four units up.

Vectors are useful in many areas of science and engineering because they can represent things like force, velocity, and much more. You can add vectors together, stretch them, and do all sorts of math with them to solve real-world problems. So, in essence, vectors are mathematical tools that help us describe and work with quantities that have both direction and magnitude.

x_{1} \\
x_{2} \\
\vdots \\
x_{m}
\end{bmatrix}$
