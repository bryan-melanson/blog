# Jarring One Loose

Is there any way to prevent a cat from crapping himself? My cat flies a few
times a year and as part of the genius Air Canada pet policy has to be muscled
under the seat for the entirety of a trans-Maritime flight. Somewhere through
a 3 hour flight (not including the interminable landlocked portion of the
travel), he craps himself, and because most people on the flight haven't seen
a cat carrier go under my seat, it's painfully logical to the whole plane that
the crap is instead in my pants. It's gotten so regular that I've become numb
to the furtive sniffs that become a common part of the next 3+ hours of my life,
because this doesn't stop after you exit the plane. You have to wait at the
luggage carousel, sit in a taxi, and try your best to act so non-chalant that it
would be crazy to imagine a crap in your pants. We all feel the microseconds of
hesitation when something stinks where you're wondering if maybe it's you - I'm
forced to live in those microseconds of strangers' lives every time I fly with
this crap factory.
